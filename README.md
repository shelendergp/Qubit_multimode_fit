# Qubit_multimode_fit
This repository calculates the values of Ej, Ec, El, g, and w for the fluxonium coupled to the multimode cavity from the two-tone data. To use this repository, one has to work with the MainScript.py file and specify the following parameters: Ej, Ec, El, w1, w2, ..., wn, g1, g2, ..., gn, integer_flux_current_per_phi0, and the number of oscillators. With this repository, you can:

(i) Plot the 2D data
(ii) Observe the eigenenergies
(iii) Fit the two-tone spectroscopy data to find the values of Ej, Ec, El, wn, and gn
