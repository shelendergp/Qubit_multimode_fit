# Qubit_multimode_fit
This is the work in progress and there may be mistakes
The repository calcaultes the Ej, Ec, El, g and w values of the fluxonium coupled to the multimode cavity from the two tone data data.
One need to specify the paths of the file
one can plot the data and look at the eigen energies and one only need to specify the Ej, Ec, El, w1, w2--wn, g1, g2--gn, integre_flux_ current per phi0 and the number of modes.
The MainScript is self explanotary
